TODO:
- draw.io sometimes sprinkles HTML into names and text (component names, port names, gate names) - in the best of all worlds, we should do a recursive-descent parse of anything that looks like HTML and extract/return the non-HTML content (simply deleting the HTML works for 1-level deep HTML, but, doesn't work for HTML wrapped in HTML)
